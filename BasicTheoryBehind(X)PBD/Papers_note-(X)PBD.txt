#(1987)enrgy constraints on parameterized models
A : Demetri Terzopoulos (Schlumberger Palo Alto Research), John Platt(Caltech), Alan Barr(caltech), Kurt Fleischer(SPAR)
C : SIGGRAPH '87
A : ``[Witkin, Fleischer, and Barr 87] uses "energy'' constraints to assemble 3D models,
	for changing the shape of parametrically-defined primitive objects.''
	Employed elasticity theory to construct differential equations that model
	the behavior of non-rigid curves, surfaces and solids as a function fo time.
	The differential equations are used for the computer animations.
M : Conventional animation methods can only simulate kinematically.
	If animators want to make plausible pseudo-dynamic animation, they must have expertise.
	Then this paper proposed elasticity theory to animate dynamic behaviors.

#(1987)Elastically Deformable Models 
A : Demetri Terzopoulos(Schlumberger Palo Alto Research), Jhon Platt(caltech), Alan Barr(Caltech), Kurt Fleischer(SPAR)
C : SIGGRAPH 1987
A : There is a large body of work on the simulation of deformable objects in computer graphics going back to the work of Terzopoulos
et al. [1987].
General penalty forces derived from energy functions for simulating deformable elastic 
objects were introduced in the graphics literature by [Terzopoulos et al. 1987].
M : Conventional theory in computer graphics couldn't handle elasticity well. 
	Then this paper introduced strain energy to address the problem.
M : Formulating elastic law of motion, strain energy, and force.
	And explain how to discretize elastic bodies and how numerical integration be done.
D : This paper also showed the importance of time-step size.
I : Achieved simulating elastic phenomena.
K : Finite element method, elastic body, Lagrange's form
U : A more sophisticated formulation or numerical integration method is desirable.
R : The pioneer work in physical simulation.

A : We refer the interested reader to [Nealen
et al. 2006] for a more complete survey on the simulation
of deformable objects and to [Witkin 1997; Erleben 2013] for
constrained dynamics.
Classical methods determine forces to simulate a dynamic system with constraints. This is done, e.g. 
by defining a potential energy E = k2C2 and deriving the forces as f = −∇E (soft constraints)
or via Lagrange multipliers derived from constrained dynamics (hard constraints) [Wit97].

###(1998)Large Steps in Cloth Simulation
A : Instead, we define internal behavior by formulating a
vector condition C(x) which we want to be zero, and then defining
the associated energy as k
2C(x)TC(x) where k is a stiffness constant.
Since that time, the use of explicit integration became popular
A : until Baraff and Witkin [1998] proposed a implicit backward Euler
scheme for handling all the forces implicitly, including damping
in cloth simulation.

It is well known in physics that kinematic
constraints of the form1 φi(x) = 0 are the physical limit of strong
potential forces of the form (ki/2)φ^2_i(x), for very large ki and this
has lead to two main strategies for solving constrained system.
In the case of distance constraints the corresponding potential is a
spring potential, with spring stiffness α −1

A : 
C : 
A : By replacing solver iterations with
substeps, Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods become competitors of
global solvers in terms of convergence. Substepping in combination with one NPGS iteration per substep yields a method that looks
computationally almost identical to an explicit integration step, but
with the advantage of being unconditionally stable due to the usage
of compliance.

	Note that this paper has supplemental that we can't get from Müller's website 
	(but we can get it from Miles Macklin's website).
