	``[Witkin, Fleischer, and Barr 87] uses "energy'' constraints to assemble 3D models,
	for changing the shape of parametrically-defined primitive objects.'' : missing

	######my summary#######
	This paper employed elasticity theory to construct differential equations that model
	the behavior of non-rigid curves, surfaces and solids as a function fo time.
	The differential equations are used for the computer animations.
M : There are two tasks when constructing a model: creating shape and setting parameters 
	so that a plausible simulation is done. 
	Particularly, the latter is tedious when the model is composed of enormous primitives.
	Then, this paper provides ``constraint energy'' which can allow parameterization of the 
	model automatically for plausible simulation.
M : Introducing ``constraint energy'' and then solving the matters described above.
	Because every constraint is formulated into scalar energy, we don't have to be concerned about mutual dependency.
	We can solve overdetermined -- there is no analytical solution -- systems 
	because we simulate a motion through the energy minimization task.
D : The proposed method uses the steepest descent method when solving the energy minimization problem.
	The constraints are not related to physical phenomena in this paper.
	User interaction is used to avoid the local minimum of the sum of the energy.
I : Some examples using the constraints presented.
K : Constrained dynamics
U : 
R : This is the first paper that uses constraints for conserving geometric property. Previous research used constraints for motion.
	The shape representations are quite different from the current ones 
	and the constraints presented in this paper are slightly inconvenient
	to the current ones. Thus, we no longer have to read this though we can say it has historical value.

A : ###being referred as###
	``Closest to [1987]'s in approach are Barzel and Barr's dynauric constraints[1988].'' : missing
M : Conventional physical simulation methods suffer from implementation difficulty, 
	hardship of control, and high computational cost.
	Then, this paper suggests a new physical simulation that is at least easy to implement.
M : This paper provided a modeling system, used constraints to construct an object with primitives like being glued,
	and solved physical problems with constraints by deriving forces from constraints 
	with inverse dynamics.
D : The constraints provided in this paper are point-to-nail (moves object's end to pinned point),
	point-to-point (glues two objects), point-to-path(moves a point on an object along an arbitrarily defined line),
	orientation (rotates object to a desired direction), point-on-line and sphere-to-sphere.
	This paper uses linear simultaneous equations when deriving forces.
	The framework was written in Lisp.
I : It seems to work well.
K : dynamic constraints, a physicall-based technique for constraint-based control of computer graphics models.
U : Collisions are not handled in this paper.
	Soft body objects are not handled to.
R : This paper uses constraints as models' motion rather than to hold a model's detail.
	In other words, the constraints determine objects' behavior.
	The points that are difficult to understand are that the paper doesn't describe the background of the equation derivation
	and that the symbols are scattered too much.

	``until Baraff and Witkin [1998] proposed a implicit backward 
	Euler scheme for handling all the forces implicitly, including damping in cloth simulation. ''

	######my summary#######
	The method introduced in this paper solves the cloth simulation which is composed of stretch/shear/bend constraints with a modified conjugate gradient method.
	This paper brings again the implicit solver to cloth simulation that used the initial physical simulation work.
M : In the cloth simulations, which hardly stretch despite capable bending or shearing, in other words,
	cloth simulation causes stiff equations that force very small timesteps to the explicit integrate methods such as Euler's method or Runge-Kutta methods, etc.
	Then, the authors wanted to reduce the computation costs described above.
M : They directly formulated contact and geometric constraints without additional energy functions of Lagrange-multiplier forces that make implicit integration tedious.
D : ``Instead, we define internal behavior by formulating a vector condition C(x) which we want to be zero,
	and then defining the associated energy as (k/2)C(x)TC(x) where k is a stiffness constant.''
	The authors formulate the energy function to a quadratic form that has easiness in numerical computation.
	Contributions of this paper could be said to formulate constraints for cloth and damping force and, to use implicit integration for physical simulation.
	``If the particle is constrained in all three dimensions, then we are explicitly setting the particle’s velocity (at the next step).
	If the constraint is in two or one dimensions, we are constraining the
	particle’s velocity along either two or one mutually orthogonal axes.''
	↑This part is not intuitive(compared to PBD).
	The problem this paper have to solve is definite liniear equations that can use CG method. 
I : They achieved faster simulation than previous ones, correctly handled bending terms, and then, were capable of large-scale simulations.
K : implicit method, constraints (conditions), sparse definite matrix computation 
U : There was nothing written.
R : This paper describes detailed physical simulation with constraints using implicit integration.
	It is worth reading because the method is basic physical simulation now.

	``Jakobsen [Jak01] built his Fysix engine on a position based approach. His central idea 
	was to use a Verlet integrator and manipulate positions directly.
	The author called this method " velocity-less ".'' : PBD
M : This paper suggests a real-time physical simulation method for mainly video games that concerns believability rather than accuracy.
M : The method uses a position-based approach and tolerates subtle inaccuracy to make simulation faster.
D : The method models rigid bodies as particles with constraints and uses the Velet integration scheme and sophisticated collision handling.
	It isn't necessary to cancel velocity when a collision occurs because velocity isn't used explicitly; just correct its position so that it doesn't penetrate.
	The method uses the distance constraints that can be considered an infinitely stiff spring.
	Verlet integrator doesn't accumulate errors.
I : Fast and stable real-time simulation 
K : Verlet integrator, constraints
U : Tetrahedron model for rigid bodies 
R : The concepts for PBD appear here, specifically, using distance and angular constraints, 
	modifying vertices' positions directly, and solving constraints with some iterations.

	contains insights into PBD, and presents source codes.

	``An alternative method for parallelizing PBD is to use a Jacobi-style constraint solver.
	In a Jacobi solve, each constraint may be processed in parallel, and the position delta for each particle obtained by summing
	the delta from each constraint at the end of an iteration.
	Jacobi methods often converge significantly slower than GaussSeidel iteration, and may not converge at all,
	for example if the system matrix is not positive definite. To address this problem, 
	underrelaxation based on the concept of constraint averaging [BFA02]can be applied.'' : (2017)A Survey on Position Based Dynamics

	####from this paper####
	``We present an algorithm to efficiently and robustly process collisions, contact and friction in cloth simulation. It works with any
	technique for simulating the internal dynamics of the cloth, and allows true modeling of 
	cloth thickness.''

	``Our robust geometric collision algorithm is the first scheme that
	guarantees no dynamic self-interference of cloth.''

	`` Since our method avoids nonphysical self-interference altogether,
	we do not need large repulsion forces or complicated and unreliable algorithms 
	for detecting and fixing self-intersection.''

	``. That is, the result of the time evolution is merely used as an initial guess 
	for the final position of the cloth. Then this initial guess is modified to account for any collisions. 
	This allows us to easily integrate our collision, contact and friction processing algorithm 
	with a pre-existing cloth dynamics engine.''

	######my summary#######

M : In Conventional cloth simulation methods, collisions are a major bottleneck.
M : Combining a fail-safe geometric collision method with a fast (non-stiff) repulsion force method
	that models cloth tickness as well as both static and kinetic friction.

	The method doesn't work directly with posiitons but only obtain positions by integrating velocities.
	The cloth solver uses Jacobi-type one to avoid the result to have a solve-order dependency.
	This solver once computes mid-step states and uses it for the collision detection/reaction and next step's state.

D : The Strain limiting often used in the cloth simulation to improve simulation quality moves the vertices directory. As a consequence, self-intersections can't be avoided.
	Then, the authors decided not to modify the vertices but the velocities that can be used at the collision detection stage.
I : The method can simulate self-intersection, drape, and static/kinetic friction stabler than previous methods.
K : impluse, repulsion spring, central time differencing
U : Interactions between cloth with sharp objects and the behavior fo cloth when trapped in between two solid deformable or rigidbody were not addressed.
R : This scheme separates physical simulation into internal parts and external parts. 
	Therefore, we can choose the internal modeling(e.g. mass-spring) and the external modeling(e.g. collision repulsion, friction, or gravity) independently. 
	However, the scheme is not directly related to PBD.

	``We focus here on numerically stable methods for integrating elastic deformable objects at interactive rates over a wide range of stiffness,
	including incompressibility and the nearly rigid limit, and on establishing a clear correspondence between the known material parameters used
	in elasticity theory–such as Young’s modulus–to the simulation parameters''
	######my summary#######
	a compliant version of elasticity that fits naturally inside constrained rigid body simulators
M : Conventional methods suffer from simulation where high-stiffness materials are included and ignore the relation between the simulation parameters and the physical material parameters.
M : This method doesn't use forces from geometric constraints to hold objects' shape but forces from elastic energy.
	This paper also presented stable and feasible integrator that enables to simulate high stiffness Materials.
D : The computational bottleneck are the computation of the Jacobian and constraint, building and solving the matrix equation.
	``It is well known in physics that kinematic constraints of the form1 φi(x) = 0 are the physical limit of strong potential forces of the form (ki/2)φ^2_i(x)''
I : The method showed realistic deformation which fits theory and achieved high-stiffness material simulation where Young's module 1000.0 GPa e.t.c.
K : Young's module, sympletic Euler, high-stiffness
U : The energy dissipation is inverse propotion of timestep size.
	This method can simulate in real-time where tetrahedra are up to nearly 200.
R : This paper introduces physical parameters into constrained dynamics; the spirit is inherited by XPBD.
	But I think this paper does explain the concept poorly,e. g. the integrator provided here, equation (20) lack of explanation, etc.

	####from this paper####
	######my summary#######
	This paper said the method introduced here builds a bridge between implicit Euler integration scheme and PBD.
	The method has simple form, performance and robustness.

M : PBD is one of the most popular methods for physical simulation. However, it has some unfavorable behaviors 
	(e.g. number of timesteps dependency or meshing dependency) because it is not rigorously derived from continuum mechanics.
M :	Introducing energy potentials with a specific structure. 
	The constraints used in this paper are derived from the continuum theory.
	Taking advantage of local solver and global solver. 
D :	The method accounts for the momentum neglected at PBD, uses the Jacobi Solver instead of the Gauss-Seidel Solver to suppress the oscillation of the simulation result,
	and uses constraints derived from continuum mechanics for consistency over meshes even if it poses a poor condition and fast convergence.
I : this method is guaranteed to weakly decrease the energy making any safeguards unnecessay and giving robustness.
	Projective dynamics has to be taken many iterations than Newton's method, but, because it's small time steps, the former converges faster than the latter.
	This method takes about 30ms on MacBookPro 2.7GHz Intel Quad-core iy with 16GB of memory.
K : Nonliner Elastic potentials, global/rocal solver, PBD, project onto manifold, Laplace-Beltrami operator
U : There is implicit damping.
R : This paper depicts PBD's weakness, which results in dependency on iteration times and introduces momentum constraints to remove them.

	``Narain et al. [2016] applies the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for implicit time integration.

	``We apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization algorithm
	to implicit time integration of elastic bodies, and show that the resulting method closely
	relates to the recently proposed projective dynamics algorithm''
	######my summary#######
	This is the method that has properties: 
	・Generic method that supports arbitrary conservative forces.
	・highly parallelizable
	・robust to large time steps and nonsmooth energies, and
	・the special case of linear forces, it is identical to projective dynamics
M : In current methods, the nonlinear materials are difficult to simulate robustly in real-time.
M :	Applying ADMM to the time integration of nonlinear elastic forces.
D :	The method can be considered to be a generalized projective dynamics for arbitrary conservative forces, including nonlinear elasticity.
I : The simulation results presented the versatility of ADMM,
	and the computational times were close to real-time.
K : ADMM, projective dynamics, hard constraints, arbitrarily elasticity
U : Applying more optimization such as Chebyshev acceleration.
R : ADMM is popular now because of its robustness, parallelizability, and simplicity.

	By replacing solver iterations with
	substeps, Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods become competitors of
	global solvers in terms of convergence. Substepping in combination with one NPGS iteration per substep yields a method that looks
	computationally almost identical to an explicit integration step, but
	with the advantage of being unconditionally stable due to the usage of compliance.
