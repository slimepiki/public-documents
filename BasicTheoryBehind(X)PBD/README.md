# aim of this document

This document introducts basic theory behind (X)PBD.

The defference between this document and the PBD survey[1] is what is explained; the former is WHY PBD works and latter is HOW PBD works.
In other words, this document explains the theory behind PBD and [1] explains structure and improoovement of PBD.

If you find any error or have any question, please let me know at discussions tab.
I wrote this survey not only to study PBD, but also to practice writing documents in English, so please let me know mistakes in my English if you don't mind.
