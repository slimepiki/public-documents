	#constraints from continuum mechanics
		#method 1 (2014)Position-Based Simulation of Continuous Materials
			constraint that energy to be zero 
		#method 2 (2014)strainBasedDynamics
			stretch/shear constraint that derived from strain tensor
			in addition them, volume conservation constraint derived from deformation gradient
			the improvement shear/stretch constraint is mentioned at (2017)cource note but I couldn't find original paper.
