A : We refer the interested reader to [Nealen
et al. 2006] for a more complete survey on the simulation
of deformable objects and to [Witkin 1997; Erleben 2013] for
constrained dynamics.
Classical methods determine forces to simulate a dynamic system with constraints. This is done, e.g. 
by defining a potential energy E = k2C2 and deriving the forces as f = −∇E (soft constraints)
or via Lagrange multipliers derived from constrained dynamics (hard constraints) [Wit97].

###(1998)Large Steps in Cloth Simulation

##(2006)Interactive Simulation of Elastic Deformable Materials
A : a compliant version of elasticity that
fits naturally inside constrained rigid body simulators
It is well known in physics that kinematic
constraints of the form1 φi(x) = 0 are the physical limit of strong
potential forces of the form (ki/2)φ^2_i(x), for very large ki and this
has lead to two main strategies for solving constrained system.
In the case of distance constraints the corresponding potential is a
spring potential, with spring stiffness α −1

A : By replacing solver iterations with
substeps, Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods become competitors of
global solvers in terms of convergence. Substepping in combination with one NPGS iteration per substep yields a method that looks
computationally almost identical to an explicit integration step, but
with the advantage of being unconditionally stable due to the usage
of compliance.
