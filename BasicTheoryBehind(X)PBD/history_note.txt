#(1987)enrgy_constraints_on_parameterized_models
[Witkin, Fleischer, and Barr 87] uses "energy'' constraints to assemble 3D models,
for changing the shape of parametrically-defined primitive objects.

General penalty forces derived from energy functions for simulating deformable elastic 
objects were introduced in the graphics literature by [Terzopoulos et al. 1987].

#(1997)An_introduction_to_constraints
We refer the interested reader to [Nealen
et al. 2006] for a more complete survey on the simulation
of deformable objects and to [Witkin 1997; Erleben 2013] for
constrained dynamics.
Classical methods determine forces to simulate a dynamic system with constraints. This is done, e.g. 
by defining a potential energy E = k2C2 and deriving the forces as f = −∇E (soft constraints)
or via Lagrange multipliers derived from constrained dynamics (hard constraints) [Wit97].

###(1998)Large Steps in Cloth Simulation
Instead, we define internal behavior by formulating a
vector condition C(x) which we want to be zero, and then defining
the associated energy as k
2C(x)TC(x) where k is a stiffness constant.

Since that time, the use of explicit integration became popular
until Baraff and Witkin [1998] proposed a implicit backward Euler
scheme for handling all the forces implicitly, including damping
in cloth simulation. 

#(1999)interactive_animation_predictor_collector
 Desbrun et al. [1999] sped up the computation
by using a predictor-corrector approach to compute an approximate solution to implicit integration.

(2001)Advanced Character Physics
Jakobsen [Jak01] built his Fysix engine on a position based approach. His central idea 
was to use a Verlet integrator and manipulate positions directly.
The idea of using standard energy terms for generating penalty force has also been
used several times before [Terzopoulos et al. 1987][Teschner et al.2004].

#(2006)A Quadratic Bending Model for Inextensible Surfaces
A bending constraint for inextensible surfaces was introduced
in [BKCW14]. The definition of this constraint is based on the discrete isometric bending model of Bergou et al. [BWH∗
06], which can be applied if a surface deforms isometrically, i.e., if the edge
lengths remain invariant

##(2006)Interactive Simulation of Elastic Deformable Materials
a compliant version of elasticity that
fits naturally inside constrained rigid body simulators
It is well known in physics that kinematic
constraints of the form1 φi(x) = 0 are the physical limit of strong
potential forces of the form (ki/2)φ^2_i(x), for very large ki and this
has lead to two main strategies for solving constrained system.
In the case of distance constraints the corresponding potential is a
spring potential, with spring stiffness α −1


#(2008)Animating Developable Surfaces using Nonconforming Elements
Now we have established the connection to backward Euler, we
can apply higher order integration schemes to PBD. Following the
derivation in [EB08] we will adapt BDF2, a second order accurate
multistep method. First, we write the second order accurate BDF2

#(2018)smallsteps(stabilize XPBD by simple way)
By replacing solver iterations with
substeps, Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods become competitors of
global solvers in terms of convergence. Substepping in combination with one NPGS iteration per substep yields a method that looks
computationally almost identical to an explicit integration step, but
with the advantage of being unconditionally stable due to the usage
of compliance.
