#(1987)Elastically Deformable Models 
A : Demetri Terzopoulos(Schlumberger Palo Alto Research), Jhon Platt(caltech), Alan Barr(Caltech), Kurt Fleischer(SPAR)
C : SIGGRAPH 1987
A : There is a large body of work on the simulation of deformable objects in computer graphics going back to the work of Terzopoulos
et al. [1987].
General penalty forces derived from energy functions for simulating deformable elastic 
objects were introduced in the graphics literature by [Terzopoulos et al. 1987].
M : Conventional theory in computer graphics couldn't handle elasticity well. 
	Then this paper introduced strain energy to address the problem.
M : Formulating elastic law of motion, strain energy, and force.
	And explain how to discretize elastic bodies and how numerical integration be done.
D : This paper simplifies elasticity theory based on principles of mathematical physics.
	This paper also showed the importance of time-step size.
I : Achieved simulating elastic phenomena.
K : Finite element method, elastic body, Lagrange's form
U : A more sophisticated formulation or numerical integration method is desirable.
R : The pioneer work in physical simulation.

(1987)enregy constraints on parameterized models
A : Andrew Witkin(Schlumberger Palo Alto), Kurt Fleischer(ditto), Alan Barr(Caltech)
C : SIGGRAPH 1987
A : ``[Witkin, Fleischer, and Barr 87] uses "energy'' constraints to assemble 3D models,
	for changing the shape of parametrically-defined primitive objects.''
	Employed elasticity theory to construct differential equations that model
	the behavior of non-rigid curves, surfaces and solids as a function fo time.
	The differential equations are used for the computer animations.
M : There are two tasks when constructing a model: creating shape and setting parameters 
	so that a plausible simulation is done. 
	Particularly, the latter is tedious when the model is composed of enormous primitives.
	Then, this paper provides ``constraint energy'' which can allow parameterization of the 
	model automatically for plausible simulation.
M : Introducing ``constraint energy'' and then solving the matters described above.
	Because every constraint is formulated into scalar energy, we don't have to be concerned about mutual dependency.
	We can solve overdetermined -- there is no analytical solution -- systems 
	because we simulate a motion through the energy minimization task.
D : The proposed method uses the steepest descent method when solving the energy minimization problem.
	The constraints are not related to physical phenomena in this paper.
	User interaction is used to avoid the local minimum of the sum of the energy.
I : Some examples using the constraints presented.
K : Constrained dynamics
U : 
R : This is the first paper that uses constraints for conserving geometric property. Previous research used constraints for motion.
	The shape representations are quite different from the current ones 
	and the constraints presented in this paper are slightly inconvenient
	to the current ones. Thus, we no longer have to read this though we can say it has historical value.

(1988)a modeling system based on dynamic constraints
A : Ronen Barzel (Caltech), Alan Barr (Caltech)
C : SIGGRAPH 1988
A : Closest to [1987]'s in approach are Barzel and Barr's dynauric constraints[1988].
M : Conventional physical simulation methods suffer from implementation difficulty, 
	hardship of control, and high computational cost.
	Then, this paper suggests a new physical simulation that is at least easy to implement.
M : This paper provided a modeling system, used constraints to construct an object with primitives like being glued,
	and solved physical problems with constraints by deriving forces from constraints 
	with inverse dynamics.
D : The constraints provided in this paper are point-to-nail (moves object's end to pinned point),
	point-to-point (glues two objects), point-to-path(moves a point on an object along an arbitrarily defined line),
	orientation (rotates object to a desired direction), point-on-line and sphere-to-sphere.
	This paper uses linear simultaneous equations when deriving forces.
	The framework was written in Lisp.
I : It seems to work well.
K : dynamic constraints, a physicall-based technique for constraint-based control of computer graphics models.
U : Collisions are not handled in this paper.
	Soft body objects are not handled to.
R : This paper uses constraints as models' motion rather than to hold a model's detail.
	In other words, the constraints determine objects' behavior.
	The points that are difficult to understand are that the paper doesn't describe the background of the equation derivation
	and that the symbols are scattered too much.

A : We refer the interested reader to [Nealen
et al. 2006] for a more complete survey on the simulation
of deformable objects and to [Witkin 1997; Erleben 2013] for
constrained dynamics.
Classical methods determine forces to simulate a dynamic system with constraints. This is done, e.g. 
by defining a potential energy E = k2C2 and deriving the forces as f = −∇E (soft constraints)
or via Lagrange multipliers derived from constrained dynamics (hard constraints) [Wit97].

##(1998)Large Steps in Cloth Simulation
A : David Baraff (Carnegie Mellon), Andrew Witkin (Carnegie Mellon)
C : SIGGRAPH 1998
A : ``until Baraff and Witkin [1998] proposed a implicit backward Euler
scheme for handling all the forces implicitly, including damping
in cloth simulation. ''
	The method introduced in this paper solves the cloth simulation which is composed of stretch/shear/bend constraints with a modified conjugate gradient method.
	This paper brings again the implicit solver to cloth simulation that used the initial physical simulation work.
M : In the cloth simulations, which hardly stretch despite capable bending or shearing, in other words,
	cloth simulation causes stiff equations that force very small timesteps to the explicit integrate methods such as Euler's method or Runge-Kutta methods, etc.
	Then, the authors wanted to reduce the computation costs described above.
M : They directly formulated contact and geometric constraints without additional energy functions of Lagrange-multiplier forces that make implicit integration tedious.
D : ``Instead, we define internal behavior by formulating a vector condition C(x) which we want to be zero,
	and then defining the associated energy as (k/2)C(x)TC(x) where k is a stiffness constant.''
	The authors formulate the energy function to a quadratic form that has easiness in numerical computation.
	Contributions of this paper could be said to formulate constraints for cloth and damping force and, to use implicit integration for physical simulation.
	``If the particle is constrained in all three dimensions, then we are explicitly setting the particle’s velocity (at the next step).
	If the constraint is in two or one dimensions, we are constraining the
	particle’s velocity along either two or one mutually orthogonal axes.''
	↑This part is not intuitive(compared to PBD).
	The problem this paper have to solve is definite liniear equations that can use CG method. 
I : They achieved faster simulation than previous ones, correctly handled bending terms, and then, were capable of large-scale simulations.
K : implicit method, constraints (conditions), sparse definite matrix computation 
U : There was nothing written.
R : This paper describes detailed physical simulation with constraints using implicit integration.
	It is worth reading because the method is basic physical simulation now.

A : Thomas Jakobsen
C : In Game Developers Conference Proceedings 2001
A : Jakobsen [Jak01] built his Fysix engine on a position based approach. His central idea 
	was to use a Verlet integrator and manipulate positions directly.
	The author called this method " velocity-less ".
M : This paper suggests a real-time physical simulation method for mainly video games that concerns believability rather than accuracy.
M : The method uses a position-based approach and tolerates subtle inaccuracy to make simulation faster.
D : The method models rigid bodies as particles with constraints and uses the Velet integration scheme and sophisticated collision handling.
	It isn't necessary to cancel velocity when a collision occurs because velocity isn't used explicitly; just correct its position so that it doesn't penetrate.
	The method uses the distance constraints that can be considered an infinitely stiff spring.
	Verlet integrator doesn't accumulate errors.
I : Fast and stable real-time simulation 
K : Verlet integrator, constraints
U : Tetrahedron model for rigid bodies 
R : The framework of PBD can be seen here. Specifically,using distance and angular constraints, modifying verticies' position directoly and solving constraints with some iterations. This paper is easier to read than PBD, but the ideas appear here and pseudo codes are presented. I recommend reading this before read PBD.

A : 
C : 
A : A bending constraint for inextensible surfaces was introduced
in [BKCW14]. The definition of this constraint is based on the discrete isometric bending model of Bergou et al. [BWH∗
06], which can be applied if a surface deforms isometrically, i.e., if the edge
lengths remain invariant

A : a compliant version of elasticity that fits naturally inside constrained rigid body simulators
	``We focus here on numerically stable methods for integrating elastic deformable objects at interactive rates over a wide range of stiffness, including incompressibility and the nearly rigid limit, and on establishing a clear correspondence between the known material parameters used in elasticity theory–such as Young’s modulus–to the simulation parameters''
M : Conventional methods suffer from simulation where high-stiffness materials are included and ignore the relation between the simulation parameters and the physical material parameters.
M : This method doesn't use forces from geometric constraints to hold objects' shape but forces from elastic energy.
	This paper also presented stable and feasible integrator that enables to simulate high stiffness Materials.
D : The computational bottleneck are the computation of the Jacobian and constraint, building and solving the matrix equation.
	``It is well known in physics that kinematic constraints of the form1 φi(x) = 0 are the physical limit of strong potential forces of the form (ki/2)φ^2_i(x)''
I : The method showed realistic deformation which fits theory and achieved high-stiffness material simulation where Young's module 1000.0 GPa e.t.c.
K : Young's module, sympletic Euler, high-stiffness
U : The energy dissipation is inverse propotion of timestep size.
	This method can simulate in real-time where tetrahedra are up to nearly 200.
R : This paper introduces physical parameters into constrained dynamics; the spirit is inherited by XPBD.
	But I think this paper does explain the concept poorly,e. g. the integrator provided here, equation (20) lack of explanation, etc.

C : TOG 2007
A : ``A number of works use a global approach in solving constraints.
Goldenthal et al. [2007] proposes a projection method for enforcing
inextensible constraints similar to PBD, but where the constrained
system is globally linearized and solved with a direct method at each
iteration'' : XPBD(2017)

``If M 6= 3N the resulting matrix of the linear system is nonsymmetric and not invertible. Goldenthal et al. [GHF∗
07] solve this problem by using the pseudo-inverse of the system matrix which
yields the best solution in the least-squares sense. Still, handling
inequalities is not possible directly'' : PBD cource note(2017)

M : Conventional cloth simulation methods tend to simulate cloth stretching while general textiles do not. This paper introduces a method of addressing the matter.
M : The goal is achieved by using Constrainded Lagrangian Mechanics and a novel fast projection method.
D : The distance constraint used here is different from ||x_1 - x_2|| - l = 0; it's ||x_1 - x_2||^2/l - l = 0. I don't know the reason.

C : TOG 2014
A : This paper said the method introduced here builds a bridge between implicit Euler integration scheme and PBD.
	The method has simple form, performance and robustness.
M : PBD is one of the most popular methods for physical simulation. However, it has some unfavorable behaviors 
	(e.g. number of timesteps dependency or meshing dependency) because it is not rigorously derived from continuum mechanics.
M :	Introducing energy potentials with a specific structure. 
	The constraints used in this paper are derived from the continuum theory.
	Taking advantage of local solver and global solver. 
D :	The method accounts for the momentum neglected at PBD, uses the Jacobi Solver instead of the Gauss-Seidel Solver to suppress the oscillation of the simulation result,
	and uses constraints derived from continuum mechanics for consistency over meshes even if it poses a poor condition and fast convergence.
I : this method is guaranteed to weakly decrease the energy making any safeguards unnecessay and giving robustness.
	Projective dynamics has to be taken many iterations than Newton's method, but, because it's small time steps, the former converges faster than the latter.
	This method takes about 30ms on MacBookPro 2.7GHz Intel Quad-core iy with 16GB of memory.
K : Nonliner Elastic potentials, global/rocal solver, PBD, project onto manifold, Laplace-Beltrami operator
U : There is implicit damping.
R : This paper depicts PBD's weakness, which results in dependency on iteration times and introduces momentum constraints to remove them.
	``Unlike Projective Dynamics [Bouaziz et al. 2014] our method is only an approximation of an implicit Euler integrator.'' from XPBD.

#(2018)Small Steps in Physics Simulation
A : 
C : 
A : By replacing solver iterations with
substeps, Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods become competitors of
global solvers in terms of convergence. Substepping in combination with one NPGS iteration per substep yields a method that looks
computationally almost identical to an explicit integration step, but
with the advantage of being unconditionally stable due to the usage
of compliance.
