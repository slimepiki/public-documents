abstract = {The most popular approaches for the simulation of dynamic systems in computer graphics are force based. Internal and external forces are accumulated from which accelerations are computed based on Newton's second law of motion. A time integration method is then used to update the velocities and finally the positions of the object. A few simulation methods (most rigid body simulators) use impulse based dynamics and directly manipulate velocities. In this paper we present an approach which omits the velocity layer as well and immediately works on the positions. The main advantage of a position based approach is its controllability. Overshooting problems of explicit integration schemes in force based systems can be avoided. In addition, collision constraints can be handled easily and penetrations can be resolved completely by projecting points to valid locations. We have used the approach to build a real time cloth simulator which is part of a physics software library for games. This application demonstrates the strengths and benefits of the method.},

Our method is based on a non-smooth Newton iteration that solves the underlying nonlinear complementarity problems (NCPs) directly. This approach allows us to support nonlinear dynamics models, including hyperelastic deformable bodies and articulated rigid mechanisms, coupled through a smooth isotropic friction model. The fixed-point nature of our method means it requires only the solution of a symmetric linear system as a building block. We propose a new complementarity preconditioner for NCP functions that improves convergence, and we develop an efficient GPU-based solver based on the conjugate residual (CR) method that is suitable for interactive simulations. We show how to improve robustness using a new geometric stiffness approximation and evaluate our method’s performance on a number of robotics simulation scenarios, including dexterous manipulation and training using reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {In computer graphics, soft body simulation is often used to animate soft tissue on characters or rubber like objects. Both are highly incompressible, however commonly used models such as co-rotational FEM, show significant volume loss, even under moderate strain. The Neo-Hookean model has recently become popular in graphics. It has superior volume conservation, recovers from inverted states, and does not require a polar decomposition. However, solvers for Neo-Hookean finite-element problems are typically based on Newton methods, which require energy Hessians, their Eigen-decomposition, and sophisticated linear solvers. In addition, minimizing the energy directly in this way does not accommodate modeling incompressible materials since it would require infinitely stiff forces. In this paper we present a constraint-based model of the Neo-Hookean energy. By decomposing the energy into deviatoric (distortional), and hydrostatic (volume preserving) constraints, we can apply iterative constrained-optimization methods that require only first-order gradients. We compare our constraint-based formulation to state-of-the-art force-based solvers and show that our method is often an order of magnitude more efficient for stiff volume preserving materials.},

abstract = {We describe a scheme for time integration of mass-spring systems that makes use of a solver based on block coordinate descent. This scheme provides a fast solution for classical linear (Hookean) springs. We express the widely used implicit Euler method as an energy minimization problem and introduce spring directions as auxiliary unknown variables. The system is globally linear in the node positions, and the non-linear terms involving the directions are strictly local. Because the global linear system does not depend on run-time state, the matrix can be pre-factored, allowing for very fast iterations. Our method converges to the same final result as would be obtained by solving the standard form of implicit Euler using Newton's method. Although the asymptotic convergence of Newton's method is faster than ours, the initial ratio of work to error reduction with our method is much faster than Newton's. For real-time visual applications, where speed and stability are more important than precision, we obtain visually acceptable results at a total cost per timestep that is only a fraction of that required for a single Newton iteration. When higher accuracy is required, our algorithm can be used to compute a good starting point for subsequent Newton's iteration.},
