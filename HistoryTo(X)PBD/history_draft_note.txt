#(1987)enrgy_constraints_on_parameterized_models
[Witkin, Fleischer, and Barr 87] uses "energy'' constraints to assemble 3D models,
for changing the shape of parametrically-defined primitive objects. 

#(1988)a_modeling_system_based_on dynamic_constraints
Closest to [1987]'s in approach are Barzel and Barr's dynauric constraints[1988].

#(1989)Constraint Methods
general constraints via a constraint function


#(1990)Interactive Dynamics
Formulation of constrained mechanical systems and techniques for solving them have
been presented before in the graphics literature in [Witkin et al. 1990]
derivation of constraint forces.


#(1997)An_introduction_to_constraints
We refer the interested reader to [Nealen
et al. 2006] for a more complete survey on the simulation
of deformable objects and to [Witkin 1997; Erleben 2013] for
constrained dynamics.

###(1998)Large Steps in Cloth Simulation
constraint  functions

Since that time, the use of explicit integration became popular
until Baraff and Witkin [1998] proposed a implicit backward Euler
scheme for handling all the forces implicitly, including damping
in cloth simulation. 



#(1999)interactive_animation_predictor_collector
 Desbrun et al. [1999] sped up the computation
by using a predictor-corrector approach to compute an approximate solution to implicit integration.

#(2004)A Versatile and Robust Model
Jakobsen [Jak01] built his Fysix engine on a position
based approach. His central idea was to use a Verlet integrator and manipulate positions directly.

#(2006)Interactive Simulation of Elastic Deformable Materials
We define general constraints via a constraint function
as [BW98] and [THMG04].

#(2006)A Quadratic Bending Model for Inextensible Surfaces
A bending constraint for inextensible surfaces was introduced
in [BKCW14]. The definition of this constraint is based on the discrete isometric bending model of Bergou et al. [BWHâˆ—
06], which
can be applied if a surface deforms isometrically, i.e., if the edge
lengths remain invariant

a compliant version of elasticity that
fits naturally inside constrained rigid body simulators

#(2008)Animating Developable Surfaces using Nonconforming Elements
Now we have established the connection to backward Euler, we
can apply higher order integration schemes to PBD. Following the
derivation in [EB08] we will adapt BDF2, a second order accurate
multistep method. First, we write the second order accurate BDF2
update equations
(second order PBD method)

proposed constraining the entries
of the Green-St Venant strain tensor to allow controlling strain in 
directions independent from the model discretization

extends PBD beyond particles and simulate rigid bodies as single entities
by introducing rotational states

#(2014)Position-Based Simulation of Continuous Materials
Recently, Bender et al. [2014a] proposed a continuum-based formulation 
that treats strain-energy as a constraint function directly

#(2015)Stable Constrained Dynamics
Tournier et al. [2015] proposed
a compliant constrained dynamics framework with support for
continuum materials, and a geometric stiffness term to stabilize a
linearly implicit time-integration.

a particle based unified solver in the position based framework

#(2018)smallsteps(stabilize XPBD by simple way)
By replacing solver iterations with
substeps, Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods become competitors of
global solvers in terms of convergence. Substepping in combination with one NPGS iteration per substep yields a method that looks
computationally almost identical to an explicit integration step, but
with the advantage of being unconditionally stable due to the usage
of compliance.
