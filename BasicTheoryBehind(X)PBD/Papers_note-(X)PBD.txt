#(1987)Elastically Deformable Models 
A : Demetri Terzopoulos(Schlumberger Palo Alto Research), Jhon Platt(caltech), Alan Barr(Caltech), Kurt Fleischer(SPAR)
C : SIGGRAPH 1987
A : There is a large body of work on the simulation of deformable objects in computer graphics going back to the work of Terzopoulos
et al. [1987].
General penalty forces derived from energy functions for simulating deformable elastic 
objects were introduced in the graphics literature by [Terzopoulos et al. 1987].
M : Conventional theory in computer graphics couldn't handle elasticity well. 
	Then this paper introduced strain energy to address the problem.
M : Formulating elastic law of motion, strain energy, and force.
	And explain how to discretize elastic bodies and how numerical integration be done.
D : This paper simplifies elasticity theory based on principles of mathematical physics.
	This paper also showed the importance of time-step size.
I : Achieved simulating elastic phenomena.
K : Finite element method, elastic body, Lagrange's form
U : A more sophisticated formulation or numerical integration method is desirable.
R : The pioneer work in physical simulation.

#(1987)enregy constraints on parameterized models
A : Andrew Witkin(Schlumberger Palo Alto), Kurt Fleischer(ditto), Alan Barr(Caltech)
C : SIGGRAPH 1987
A : ``[Witkin, Fleischer, and Barr 87] uses "energy'' constraints to assemble 3D models,
	for changing the shape of parametrically-defined primitive objects.''
	Employed elasticity theory to construct differential equations that model
	the behavior of non-rigid curves, surfaces and solids as a function fo time.
	The differential equations are used for the computer animations.
M : There are two tasks when constructing a model: creating shape and setting parameters 
	so that a plausible simulation is done. 
	Particularly, the latter is tedious when the model is composed of enormous primitives.
	Then, this paper provides ``constraint energy'' which can allow parameterization of the 
	model automatically for plausible simulation.
M : Introducing ``constraint energy'' and then solving the matters described above.
	Because every constraint is formulated into scalar energy, we don't have to be concerned about mutual dependency.
	We can solve overdetermined -- there is no analytical solution -- systems 
	because we simulate a motion through the energy minimization task.
D : The proposed method uses the steepest descent method when solving the energy minimization problem.
	The constraints are not related to physical phenomena in this paper.
	User interaction is used to avoid the local minimum of the sum of the energy.
I : Some examples using the constraints presented.
K : Constrained dynamics
U : 
R : This is the first paper that uses constraints for conserving geometric property. Previous research used constraints for motion.
	The shape representations are quite different from the current ones 
	and the constraints presented in this paper are slightly inconvenient
	to the current ones. Thus, we no longer have to read this though we can say it has historical value.

#(1988)a modeling system based on dynamic constraints
A : Ronen Barzel (Caltech), Alan Barr (Caltech)
C : SIGGRAPH 1988
A : Closest to [1987]'s in approach are Barzel and Barr's dynauric constraints[1988].
M : Conventional physical simulation methods suffer from implementation difficulty, 
	hardship of control, and high computational cost.
	Then, this paper suggests a new physical simulation that is at least easy to implement.
M : This paper provided a modeling system, used constraints to construct an object with primitives like being glued,
	and solved physical problems with constraints by deriving forces from constraints 
	with inverse dynamics.
D : The constraints provided in this paper are point-to-nail (moves object's end to pinned point),
	point-to-point (glues two objects), point-to-path(moves a point on an object along an arbitrarily defined line),
	orientation (rotates object to a desired direction), point-on-line and sphere-to-sphere.
	This paper uses linear simultaneous equations when deriving forces.
	The framework was written in Lisp.
I : It seems to work well.
K : dynamic constraints, a physicall-based technique for constraint-based control of computer graphics models.
U : Collisions are not handled in this paper.
	Soft body objects are not handled to.
R : This paper uses constraints as models' motion rather than to hold a model's detail.
	In other words, the constraints determine objects' behavior.
	The points that are difficult to understand are that the paper doesn't describe the background of the equation derivation
	and that the symbols are scattered too much.

A : We refer the interested reader to [Nealen
et al. 2006] for a more complete survey on the simulation
of deformable objects and to [Witkin 1997; Erleben 2013] for
constrained dynamics.
Classical methods determine forces to simulate a dynamic system with constraints. This is done, e.g. 
by defining a potential energy E = k2C2 and deriving the forces as f = −∇E (soft constraints)
or via Lagrange multipliers derived from constrained dynamics (hard constraints) [Wit97].

###(1998)Large Steps in Cloth Simulation
A : David Barraff (Carnegie Mellon), Andrew Witkin (Carnegie Mellon)
C : SIGGRAPH 1998
A : ``until Baraff and Witkin [1998] proposed a implicit backward Euler
scheme for handling all the forces implicitly, including damping
in cloth simulation. ''
	The method introduced in this paper solves the cloth simulation which is composed of aaaaaaaaa with a modified conjugate gradient method.
	This paper brings again the implicit solver to cloth simulation that used the initial physical simulation work.
M : In the cloth simulations, which hardly stretch despite capable bending or shearing, in other words,
	cloth simulation causes stiff equations that force very small timesteps to the explicit integrate methods such as Euler's method or Runge-Kutta methods, etc.
	Then, the authors wanted to reduce the computation costs described above.
M : They directly formulated contact and geometric constraints without additional energy functions of Lagrange-multiplier forces that make implicit integration tedious.
D : ``Instead, we define internal behavior by formulating a vector condition C(x) which we want to be zero,
	 and then defining the associated energy as (k/2)C(x)TC(x) where k is a stiffness constant.''

lengths remain invariant

It is well known in physics that kinematic
constraints of the form1 φi(x) = 0 are the physical limit of strong
potential forces of the form (ki/2)φ^2_i(x), for very large ki and this
has lead to two main strategies for solving constrained system.
In the case of distance constraints the corresponding potential is a
spring potential, with spring stiffness α −1

A : By replacing solver iterations with
substeps, Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods become competitors of
global solvers in terms of convergence. Substepping in combination with one NPGS iteration per substep yields a method that looks
computationally almost identical to an explicit integration step, but
with the advantage of being unconditionally stable due to the usage
of compliance.
